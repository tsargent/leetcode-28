# Day 14: Mock Interview

## Mock Interview Session

Try 3 medium problems or use LeetCode Interview Simulator

### Session Goals:

- Practice explaining your thought process
- Code under time pressure
- Handle follow-up questions
- Review and optimize solutions

### Recommended Approach:

1. **Problem 1 (25 minutes)**: Medium array/string problem
2. **Problem 2 (25 minutes)**: Medium tree/graph problem
3. **Problem 3 (20 minutes)**: Medium dynamic programming problem

### Interview Notes:

```ts
// Problem 1:
// - Initial approach:
// - Optimizations:
// - Time/Space complexity:

// Problem 2:
// - Initial approach:
// - Optimizations:
// - Time/Space complexity:

// Problem 3:
// - Initial approach:
// - Optimizations:
// - Time/Space complexity:
```

### Reflection:

- What went well?
- What areas need improvement?
- Which concepts to review?
