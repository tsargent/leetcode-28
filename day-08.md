https://leetcode.com/problems/fibonacci-number

The Fibonacci numbers, commonly denoted F(n) form a sequence, called the Fibonacci sequence, such that each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, starting from 0 and 1.

Given n, calculate F(n).

```ts
function fib(n: number): number {
  // TODO: Implement solution
}
```
