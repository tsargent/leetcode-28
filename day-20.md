# Day 20: Review

## Week 3 Review - Graph and Tree Problem Mix

Practice problems combining tree and graph concepts:

### Topics Covered:

- Binary Trees (Day 15)
- DFS (Day 16)
- BFS (Day 17)
- Graph Basics (Day 18)
- Topological Sort (Day 19)

### Mixed Practice Problems:

1. Tree traversal with DFS/BFS variations
2. Graph problems with different traversal methods
3. Practice topological sort variants
4. Combine tree and graph algorithms

### Suggested Focus Areas:

- Tree vs Graph traversal differences
- When to use DFS vs BFS
- Cycle detection in graphs
- Tree/Graph reconstruction problems
