# Day 23: DP 2D (Dynamic Programming)

## Unique Paths

https://leetcode.com/problems/unique-paths

There is a robot on an m x n grid. The robot is initially located at the top-left corner (i.e., grid[0][0]). The robot tries to move to the bottom-right corner (i.e., grid[m - 1][n - 1]). The robot can only move either down or right at any point in time.

Given the two integers m and n, return the number of possible unique paths that the robot can take to reach the bottom-right corner.

```ts
function uniquePaths(m: number, n: number): number {
  // TODO: Implement solution
}
```

## Coin Change

https://leetcode.com/problems/coin-change

You are given an integer array coins representing coins of different denominations and an integer amount representing a total amount of money.

Return the fewest number of coins that you need to make up that amount. If that amount of money cannot be made up by any combination of the coins, return -1.

```ts
function coinChange(coins: number[], amount: number): number {
  // TODO: Implement solution
}
```
