# Day 12: Matrix Traversal

## Flood Fill

https://leetcode.com/problems/flood-fill

An image is represented by an m x n integer grid image where image[i][j] represents the pixel value of the image.

You are also given three integers sr, sc, and color. You should perform a flood fill on the image starting from the pixel image[sr][sc].

```ts
function floodFill(
  image: number[][],
  sr: number,
  sc: number,
  color: number
): number[][] {
  // TODO: Implement solution
}
```

## Number of Islands

https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-islands

Given an m x n 2D binary grid grid which represents a map of '1's (land) and '0's (water), return the number of islands.

An island is surrounded by water and is formed by connecting adjacent lands horizontally or vertically. You may assume all four edges of the grid are all surrounded by water.

```ts
function numIslands(grid: string[][]): number {
  // TODO: Implement solution
}
```
