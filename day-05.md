# Day 05: Binary Search

## Binary Search

https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-search

Given an array of integers nums which is sorted in ascending order, and an integer target, write a function to search target in nums. If target exists, then return its index. Otherwise, return -1.

You must write an algorithm with O(log n) runtime complexity.

```ts
function search(nums: number[], target: number): number {
  // TODO: Implement solution
}
```

## First Bad Version

https://leetcode.com/problems/first-bad-version

You are a product manager and currently leading a team to develop a new product. Unfortunately, the latest version of your product fails the quality check. Since each version is developed based on the previous version, all the versions after a bad version are also bad.

Suppose you have n versions [1, 2, ..., n] and you want to find out the first bad one, which causes all the following ones to be bad.

You are given an API bool isBadVersion(version) which returns whether version is bad. Implement a function to find the first bad version. You should minimize the number of calls to the API.

```ts
// The knows API is defined in the parent class Relation.
// isBadVersion(version: number): boolean {
//     ...
// };

function solution(isBadVersion: any) {
  return function (n: number): number {
    // TODO: Implement solution
  };
}
```
