# Day 13: Review

## Week 2 Review - Backtracking and DFS/BFS Mix

Practice problems combining concepts from this week:

### Topics Covered:

- Recursion (Day 8)
- Backtracking I (Day 9)
- Backtracking II (Day 10)
- Sorting (Day 11)
- Matrix Traversal (Day 12)

### Mixed Practice Problems:

1. Try a backtracking problem with DFS
2. Solve a matrix traversal with recursion
3. Practice a sorting algorithm implementation
4. Combine BFS with backtracking concepts
