# Day 26: Edge Cases

## Longest Consecutive Sequence

https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-consecutive-sequence

Given an unsorted array of integers nums, return the length of the longest consecutive elements sequence.

You must write an algorithm that runs in O(n) time.

```ts
function longestConsecutive(nums: number[]): number {
  // TODO: Implement solution
}
```

## Valid Sudoku

https://leetcode.com/problems/valid-sudoku

Determine if a 9 x 9 Sudoku board is valid. Only the filled cells need to be validated according to the following rules:

1. Each row must contain the digits 1-9 without repetition.
2. Each column must contain the digits 1-9 without repetition.
3. Each of the nine 3 x 3 sub-boxes of the grid must contain the digits 1-9 without repetition.

```ts
function isValidSudoku(board: string[][]): boolean {
  // TODO: Implement solution
}
```

## Edge Case Practice Notes

Focus on handling:

- Empty inputs
- Single element arrays
- Duplicate values
- Integer overflow/underflow
- Boundary conditions
- Invalid inputs

```ts
// Add notes about edge cases encountered and how to handle them
```
