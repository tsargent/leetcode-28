## Subsets

https://leetcode.com/problems/subsets

Given an integer array nums of unique elements, return all possible subsets (the power set).

The solution set must not contain duplicate subsets. Return the solution in any order.

```ts
function subsets(nums: number[]): number[][] {
  // TODO: Implement solution
}
```

## Combination Sum

https://leetcode.com/problems/combination-sum

Given an array of distinct integers candidates and a target integer target, return a list of all unique combinations of candidates where the chosen numbers sum to target. You may return the combinations in any order.

The same number may be chosen from candidates an unlimited number of times. Two combinations are unique if the frequency of at least one of the chosen numbers is different.

```ts
function combinationSum(candidates: number[], target: number): number[][] {
  // TODO: Implement solution
}
```
