# Day 16: DFS (Depth-First Search)

## Path Sum

https://leetcode.com/problems/path-sum

Given the root of a binary tree and an integer targetSum, return true if the tree has a root-to-leaf path such that adding up all the values along the path equals targetSum.

A leaf is a node with no children.

```ts
function hasPathSum(root: TreeNode | null, targetSum: number): boolean {
  // TODO: Implement solution
}
```

## Diameter of Binary Tree

https://leetcode.com/problems/diameter-of-binary-tree

Given the root of a binary tree, return the length of the diameter of the tree.

The diameter of a binary tree is the length of the longest path between any two nodes in a tree. This path may or may not pass through the root.

The length of a path between two nodes is represented by the number of edges between them.

```ts
function diameterOfBinaryTree(root: TreeNode | null): number {
  // TODO: Implement solution
}
```
